# Trade Tally
A responsive web app that lets you record your service trades, so you know what your balance is (positive or negative) with any of your trade partners. See live demo [here](https://trade-tally-client.herokuapp.com/)

The backend server side code was build with Node.js and Mongo DB. The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/oneEyedBunny/Trade-Tally-Server)

## Motivation
Currently I'm a hairstylist. I trade services with a variety of people: Chiropractors, Massage Therapists, Aetheticians, etc. Problem is, we're all left manually recording the trades if we want to know who's owed who a service since our client management systems aren't linked together. I wanted an easy way to record when either party has performed a service, what the value of that service is, and what my balance is so I can determine who's turn it is. Trade Tally lets you do this. With a few clicks it provides an easy way to enter trades, see a summary of where all your trades are at, and dig into the details of your trade history.

# Pending items
1. For GET trades, discuss if I should always get all trades for summary page and then those are available in state for drill in requests or should I make another action for GET trade by ID. I have an endpoint for this already.
1. Do I need actions for trade fails?  Others dont seem to do it, but seems like we should have it to be complete.
1. CSS
1. Test cases for all
1. add in images
